## WordPress Mocks

Clone of mock files in https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPressMocks.

It contains a number of JSON files used by WireMock to handle requests and are located in `src/main/assets`.  To generate one of these files 
you're fist going to want to set up Charles to work with your Android emulator. If you've never done this I found 
[this article](https://medium.com/@daptronic/the-android-emulator-and-charles-proxy-a-love-story-595c23484e02) to be a 
good place to start. Once you've done that you'll want to walk through the specfic flow you're testing and store the JSON contents
of the necessary responses in the `jsonBody` field of the `response` field in the mock file. 

Here's an example of what this might look like,

```
{
    "request": {
        "urlPattern": "/rest/v1.1/me/",
        "method": "GET"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "jsonBody": {
            // ..... Your response here
        },
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Connection": "keep-alive",
            "Cache-Control": "no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0"
        }
    }
}
``` 

These files are used to match network requests while the tests are being ran. For more on request matching with 
WireMock check out [their documentation](http://wiremock.org/docs/request-matching/).
